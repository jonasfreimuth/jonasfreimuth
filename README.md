Heyo,  
I'm Jonas, I currently do my Masters degree in Bioinformatics at the University of Potsdam. 
Previously I did a Bachelor degree at the University of Tübingen, focusing on phenological shift of plants 
and their pollinators. I am currently investigating the results from my Bachelors thesis further, the means by which I do that 
can be seen here.
