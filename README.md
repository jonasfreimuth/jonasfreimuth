Heyo,  ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jonas, I am currently doing my Master's degree in Bioinformatics at the
University of Potsdam.

In my ongoing Master thesis project at the MDC's BIMSB
[Bioinformatics platform](https://github.com/BIMSBbioinfo/) I am investigating
the feasibility of using linear deconvolution models to improve the prediction
accurracy of methods involving bulk RNA-seq data of tumor samples
([repo](https://github.com/jonasfreimuth/master-thesis/)).

In a previous project, I worked to improve code quality and prediction accurracy
of the [PiGx-SARS-Cov-2](https://github.com/BIMSBbioinfo/pigx_sars-cov-2)
pipeline.

I did my Bachelor's degree at the University of TÃ¼bingen, focusing on
phenological shifts of plants and their pollinators. I investigated the results
further leading to my first published
[paper](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2021.2142), the analysis code of which can
be found [here](https://github.com/jonasfreimuth/Phenological-shifts-germany).

My major experiences are with R and the tidyverse, but through my university
courses I have some experience with other languages, most notably python
(and snakemake), but also some C++.
