Heyo,  ðŸ‘‹
I'm Jonas, I am currently doing my Masters degree in Bioinformatics at the University of Potsdam. 
Previously I did a Bachelor degree at the University of TÃ¼bingen, focusing on phenological shift of plants 
and their pollinators. I am currently investigating the results from my Bachelors thesis further, the means by which I do that 
can be seen here.
