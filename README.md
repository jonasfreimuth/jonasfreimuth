Heyo, ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jonas, I am a Bioinformatician with a wide interest, but mainly focussed on
transcriptomics. I have major experience are with R (especially the tidyverse)
and python in a Linux environment. While I don't have as much experience with
low-level languages, I am interested in deepening my understanding of Rust (and
perhaps C++).

In my Master thesis project at the MDC's BIMSB
[Bioinformatics platform](https://github.com/BIMSBbioinfo/) I investigated
the feasibility of using linear deconvolution models to improve the prediction
accurracy of methods involving bulk RNA-seq data of tumor samples
([repo](https://github.com/jonasfreimuth/master-thesis/)).

In a previous project, I worked to improve code quality and prediction accurracy
of the [PiGx-SARS-Cov-2](https://github.com/BIMSBbioinfo/pigx_sars-cov-2)
pipeline.

I did my Bachelor's degree at the University of TÃ¼bingen, focusing on
phenological shifts of plants and their pollinators. I investigated the results
further leading to my first published
[paper](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2021.2142), the analysis code of which can
be found [here](https://github.com/jonasfreimuth/Phenological-shifts-germany).
